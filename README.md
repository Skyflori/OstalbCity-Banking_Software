# OstalbCity-Banking_Software
This Repo contains the Sourcefiles and a demo database for a banking software, which can be used in a children's play city.
If you are not familier, what a children's play city is; itÂ´s basicaly a small scale city with different "enterprise" like a bank, townhall,carpentry and many more.
In these "enterprise" kids can do, manufacture or produce different products, which are then sold to other citizen in the city.
In the eveneig the get their daily salary, depending on the hours the "worked".

And because only cash as a payment method is boring, I programmed the OAC Banking Software.
This is a webtool for manageing the citizens and "enterprise" bank accounts.
You can do basic things like deposit and withdraw money from an account or you can do bank transfers between different accounts.
The webtool has also the ability to print bank statements for the different accounts using the main administrator account or the Printing account with just the printing function.

To install the tool, you need to set up an apache webserver with php7 and a mySQL/mariaDB Server.
